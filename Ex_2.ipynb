        "The previous code failed because the logic for identifying leaf nodes and retrieving their values in the `minimax` function was incorrect for the nested dictionary structure of `game_tree_extended`. The `minimax` function was attempting to access `current_game_tree[node]` where `node` was a leaf move name (e.g., 'A1_1_L1') which is not a top-level key in the `game_tree_extended` dictionary. The fix involves refining the leaf node detection to check if the children of the `current_node_key` are directly utility values (integers) and adjusting how the recursive calls pass the appropriate state.\n",
