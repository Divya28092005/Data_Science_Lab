        "### What is an Expert System?\n",
        "An **Expert System** is a computer program that simulates the judgment and behavior of a human expert in a specific domain. Its primary goal is to solve complex problems or provide advice by reasoning through a body of knowledge, represented primarily as if-then rules rather than through conventional procedural code.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Components of an Expert System:\n",
        "1.  **Knowledge Base:** This is the core component that stores domain-specific knowledge acquired from human experts. It typically consists of facts and, crucially for our purpose, a set of **rules** (often in an \"if-then\" format) that define relationships and conditions within the domain.\n",
        "2.  **Inference Engine:** This component acts as the 'brain' of the expert system. It processes the knowledge base to draw conclusions and make recommendations. For **rule-based decision-making**, the inference engine uses logical rules to deduce new facts or actions from existing data. It determines which rules to apply and in what order.\n",
        "3.  **Working Memory (or Fact Base):** This temporary storage holds the specific facts about the current problem being solved by the expert system. It's where the input data is placed and where intermediate conclusions are stored.\n",
        "4.  **User Interface:** This allows the user to interact with the system, input problem-specific data, and receive advice or solutions.\n",
        "5.  **Explanation Facility (Optional but common):** This module explains the reasoning process to the user, detailing how the system arrived at a particular conclusion, which is crucial for trust and debugging.\n",
        "6.  **Knowledge Acquisition Facility (Optional):** This helps in acquiring knowledge from human experts and integrating it into the knowledge base.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Rule-Based Decision-Making:\n",
        "Our focus will be on **rule-based decision-making**. In this paradigm, the expert system's intelligence comes from a collection of explicit rules defined by human experts. The inference engine then applies these rules to the available facts to reach a decision. For example, a simple rule might be: \"IF `temperature` IS `high` AND `symptoms` INCLUDE `fever` THEN `diagnosis` IS `flu`.\" This approach is transparent, making the system's logic easy to understand and audit, which is a significant advantage in many applications."
